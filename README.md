 ## Intro 
I am a self-taught full stack engineer specialising in front end development. I am continually striving to write clear, effective and tidy code. I have experience in JavaScript, TypeScript and C#, using multiple frameworks/library's for all. I excel working both independently and collaboratively. In addition i am familiar with using databases for example PostgreSQL. examples of my  organisational and time-keeping skills are highlighted through contributing to team coding projects that involve a deadline, collaboration, and effective code. I have used JIRA, Figma, to lead and participate in sprint plans and to ensure projects are kept on schedule. 
This and more can be seen in my projects below.

Currently i am changing career paths and looking for an entry level role or apprenticeship in web development to further my skills in a professional working environment.
